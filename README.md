  - **Creating Tables**: Learned how to define and create tables in the database. This includes creating primary keys and foreign keys.
  - **Inserting Data**: Gained skills in adding records to the tables.
  - **Updating Data**: Experienced to update existing table rows and display results.
  - **Running Queries**: Developed the ability to execute various types of SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
  - **Creating Relationships**: Able to create relationships between different tables.
- **SQL Queries**: Developed skills in writing SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval, including complex joins and aggregation functions.
- **PHP Integration for Web Development**: Gained experience in integrating PHP with HTML/CSS to create dynamic web pages.
- **ChartJS Integration in PHP**: Learned how to integrate ChartJS to visualize data dynamically fetched from the database.
  - **Manipulation of charts**: Learned to customize and manipulate charts to display data effectively.
  - You can check other details here: [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used Tailwind CSS to design responsive and modern web interfaces quickly and efficiently.
  - This framework eased my workflow in creating responsive and modern web interfaces with a variety of different styles.
  - Also learned more about Tailwind configuration options.

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(`checkoutDates`, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS `checkout_count`
FROM
    `checkout`
WHERE `checkoutDates` BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY
    YEAR(`checkoutDates`),
    MONTH(`checkoutDates`)
ORDER BY
    YEAR(`checkoutDates`) DESC,
    MONTH(`checkoutDates`) DESC;
```
