  - **Creating Tables**: Learned how to define and create tables in the database. This includes creating primary keys and foreign keys.
  - **Inserting Data**: Gained skills in adding records to the tables.
  - **Running Queries**: Developed the ability to execute various types of SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
  - **Creating Relationships**: Able to create relationships between different tables.
- **SQL Queries**: Developed skills in writing SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval, including complex joins and aggregation functions.

### Example SQL Queries

**Select books not checked out:**

```sql
SELECT `book`.`Title`
FROM `book`
LEFT JOIN `checkout` ON `book`.`BookID` = `checkout`.`BookID`
WHERE `checkout`.`BookID` IS NOT NULL;
```

**Get the Frequency per Month in the Year 2023:**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(`checkoutDates`, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS `checkout_count`
FROM
    `checkout`
WHERE `checkoutDates` BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY
    YEAR(`checkoutDates`),
    MONTH(`checkoutDates`)
ORDER BY
    YEAR(`checkoutDates`) DESC,
    MONTH(`checkoutDates`) DESC;
```

**Searching for Books:**

```sql
SELECT `book`.*, `checkout`.`ReturnDates`
FROM `book`
LEFT JOIN `checkout` ON `checkout`.`BookID` = `book`.`BookID`
WHERE `book`.`Title` = '$search';
```
